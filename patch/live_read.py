"""Live GP-50 bank reader. SENDS ONLY cmd=0x01 read requests (byte-identical to
Valeton Suite's, CRC-8/0x07 verified) and collects the streamed name reply.
Read-only: never sends any write/commit opcode. Gated on a patch-dump self-test.

Usage:
  python live_read.py selftest          # send [0x12,0x40], expect 100 patch names
  python live_read.py scan              # probe candidate bank selectors
  python live_read.py read <hexsel>     # read one bank selector (e.g. 0x30)

    The read protocol (selectors 0x40/0x41, CRC-8/0x07, nibble framing) is shared
    by the GP-5 and GP-50, so a scan/sync works on either once the right port is
    opened. Falls back to (PORT, GP50) when no GP-5/GP-50 is found.

    Deliberately does NOT delegate to find_port_optional() and return whatever
    it found: that resolver checks GP-150/180 first (for status-reporting
    purposes — see its docstring), and a GP-150 doesn't speak this protocol
    (re/DEVICE_GP150.md) — pointing this function's 0x40/0x41 requests at one
    would be a confusing always-empty read instead of a clear "wrong device"
    signal. Scans directly for GP-50/GP-5 instead, so a GP-150 sitting earlier
    in the port list (e.g. both connected at once) can't shadow a real GP-50.
    Use gp150_live_read.py for GP-150."""
